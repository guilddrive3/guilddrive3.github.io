/* 5.	Write a function, scoreExams, that takes an array of arrays of student answers 
and an array of the correct answers.  It should compare each studentâ€™s answers against 
the correct answers and return an array holding the scores of each student.  The score 
for each student is a count of the number of correct answers (i.e., matches with the key 
    of correct answers).  For example

const studentAnswers = [[1, 1, 2,4], [2, 1, 2,2], [3, 1, 3,4]];
const correctAnswers = [3, 1, 2,4];
scoreExams(studentAnswers, correctAnswers)); --> [3,2,3]
