/* 2. Make a defining table and function that will return the balance of a savings account that
compounds interest monthly. Parameters for the function will be:
• initial amount
• annual interest rate
• number of years to compound
Do not look up mathematical formulas for how to compute compound interest. Use a for loop that will
add the appropriate interest each month.
console.log("expect 110.47", compoundInterest(100, 10, 1));
console.log("expect 16470.09", compoundInterest(10000, 5, 10));
