/* 2.	Make a defining table and function that will return the balance of a savings account that compounds interest monthly.  Parameters for the function will be: 
•	initial amount 
•	annual interest rate
•	number of years to compound


input:  interest rate, years to compound, initial deposit
output:  final balance
processing:
 - divide interest rate by 12 to get monthly interest and by 100 to make it a fraction
 - multiply years by 12 to get number of interest payments
 - loop for the number of interest payments
   -- calculate interest for that month and add to balance
 - report the final balance
