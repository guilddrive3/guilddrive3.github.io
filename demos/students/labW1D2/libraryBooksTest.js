/*
Write a JavaScript program that will accept title, author, and libraryID values from an HTML page and create new book objects for each entry.  
â€¢	Before creating the webpage first write and test the following JavaScript functions:
o	addBook, which will take title, author, and libraryID as inputs.  It will create a new book object and add it to the library, which will be represented as a global array named libraryBooks.  addBook should return the newly created book.
o	findTitles, which will find all the book titles in libraryBooks and return them in an alphabetically ordered array.
o	findAuthors, which will find all the authors in libraryBooks and return them in an alphabetically ordered array.
o	findIDs, which will find all the libraryIDs in libraryBooks and return them in an alphabetically ordered array.
