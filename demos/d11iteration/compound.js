/* Make a defining table and program to print out the balance of a savings account that compounds interest monthly. Prompt the user for the

initial amount

annual interest rate

number of years to compound
Do not use the mathematical formula for compound interest. Use a loop that calculates the interest for each month and compounds that over the iteration—i.e., add it to the current balance. Ask the professor or TA if this is not clear.

/* defining table
inputs:  
initial amount
•
annual interest rate
•
number of years to compound

outputs:
 balance at end of years

steps:
 * get inputs
 * get monthly interest
 * loop for number of months -- years * 12
 * add interest to the balance, where interest is interest rate times balance
